# Musings about final Ethics project

## Thoughts ##

1. Security vs. convenience
    - Password managers seem to be a quintessential example of security vs. convenience. Users can either keep all their passwords locally on their home computers, which is certainly safe but not very convenient OR users can use a pasword manager from a private company that can store and autofill all your passwords.

2. Algorithmi bias
    - There are some really interesting stories about citizens, particularly citiezens of color, being targeted and wrongly accused of crimes by facial recognition software.

3. Decentralized Computing
    - There are some interesting topics about removing cloud computing but still keeping the collaboration and sharing tools.
