# Replit privacy poicy review
by Jack Padalino

-----

Dear AMS Family,
Starting this year, all Computer Science classes at AMS will be using an online web application Replit. Replit is an online computer programming platform that students will use to write and share their code with their teachers and other students. In order to access Replit and all of its features, students will have to sign up for a Replit account using their student emails and create their own password.
The AMS Computer Science department has done a review of Replit’s privacy policy, and would like to share some information with parents and guardians. Below is a list of questions we anticipate families will have along with what we have found:
##Where is my child’s data stored?##
- The information that a student’s Replit account will store will be their first name, last name, email address, and all their programming files they create on the site.
##Who has access to my child’s data?##
- From the Replit privacy policy: Replit may share a User’s personal information with vendors, consultants, and other third party service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf and at our direction.
##How long does Replit keep my child’s data?##
- From the Replit privacy policy: If a User chooses to delete their account with us, their information will be instantly deleted from the active database, however a User’s information will remain stored in our archives for up to 60 days.
##How understandable is their EULA?##
- The Replit End User License Agreement seems to be written in fairly understandable and layman language.
Would we be comfortable as a parent if our child used this?
- Yes, I would be comfortable letting my child use Replit if their CS courses required it.
